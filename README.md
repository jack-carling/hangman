## About

Halloween themed hangman game that picks a random word (in Swedish) with five tries to guess. There is also a time limit of 60 seconds per word to guess. The game listens for keyboard input and each key is only counted once. You win by guessing the correct word and lose by either guessing too many wrong letters or running out of time.
